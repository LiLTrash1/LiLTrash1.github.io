Welcome Back #\rHello, and welcome back to my portfolio.\nI took a break from my work primarily due to my mental health and some personal matters. During this time, I was also adjusting to new medication that I take to help stabilize my mood. While essential, this medication brought some challenging side effects like drowsiness, fatigue, trouble sleeping, and restlessness that made it difficult to focus and maintain a creative routine.\nSimply managing these adjustments required a lot of my energy, which meant I couldn’t dedicate time to my projects the way I wanted to.\nNow that I’m feeling more balanced, I’m grateful to be back and excited to create again.\nThank you for your patience and understanding. 1.1 Introduction #\rFor this book, I’m diving into the world of digital forensics—the practice of uncovering, analyzing, and interpreting digital evidence to build clear, actionable reports for organizations.\nBelow, you’ll find the chapters covered in the book, along with my own summaries and takeaways from each section.\n2.
