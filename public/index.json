Singh, this is a highly recommended book from Packt which have a reputation of provide top quality content for the IT industry. In this part I will be building multiple lab environments with vulnerable machines which I can utilise to test out different penetration techniques in a safe and legal network.\n1.Creating first lab within VMware # todo! add image of diagram and add links to claims The diagram demonstrate the environment for this first network lab where I will be using a popular penetration OS, Kali Linux to test out the different tools that comes within its arsenal.\nFor the virtual machine of choice I went with VMware due to previous experience with the software in the past however, upon research for different types of virtualisation I came across KVM/Qemu which is a fully open-source and a higher frequency of security update with transparent reports whereas Oracle provides security through obscurity.\n2.Setting up network interfaces using vboxmanage # Inside a terminal type the following commands\nCreate a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;PentestNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=PentestNet --server-ip=172.30.1.1 --lower-ip=172.30.1.20 --upper-ip=172.30.1.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;HiddenNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=HiddenNet --server-ip=10.11.12.1 --lower-ip=10.11.12.20 --upper-ip=10.11.12.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;RedTeamLab\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=RedTeamLab --server-ip=192.168.42.1 --lower-ip=192.168.42.20 --upper-ip=192.168.42.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable 3. Adding Machines to VMware # The next stage is to add the actual machines and connect them to the new networks I\u0026rsquo;ve created in stage 2.\n3.1 Setting up Kali Linux # Going through the standard VMware installation for Kali linux I will need to assign it to networks so it has LAN connection to the other machines.\nIn settings of Kali VM, Adapter 1: Adapter 2: Adapter 3: 3.2 Setting up Metasploitable 2 # Install the iso file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ and go through standard installation on VMware:\nIn VirtualBox New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: Metasploitable2 \u0026gt; Memory:512M \u0026gt; Hard Disk \u0026gt; Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector \u0026gt; Add Metastpoitable.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish In settings of Metasploitable 2 Adapter 1: 3.3 Setting up Metasploitable 3 # To install Metasploitable 3 I used Vagrant, a command line utility tool to manage and download virtual machines pre-made on it\u0026rsquo;s repository. The installation process is simple and can be found here https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install.\nThe following commands were used:\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest $ mkdir metasploitable3-workspace $ cd metasploitable3-workspace $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/master/Vagrantfile \u0026amp;\u0026amp; vagrant up Encountering IP address configuration error during setup When setting up Vagrant I encountered an error message on a misconfigured IP range, upon research I came across this post at stackoverflow\nIssue prompt:\ntodo! const trait ","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/part-1-buidling-a-penetration-testing-labs/","section":"Blog","summary":"Welcome to the first part of my walkthrough for \u0026lsquo;The Ultimate Kali Linux Book\u0026rsquo; by Glen D.","title":"Part 1 Building a Penetesting Testing Lab"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/ultimate-kali-linux-book/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Ultimate-Kali-Linux-Book"},{"content":" 1.

Making use of the Nmap Scripting Engine NSE # Documentation located here https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html\nThis is an engine which can run scripts such as custom types of scans, discovery and even exploit execution on targets which is quite powerful.\nIt uses the Lua programming language The currently defined categories are auth, broadcast, brute, default. discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln\nSearch script in these categories with nmap --script \u0026quot;\u0026lt;keyword\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\nScript can be found here https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/\nrunning nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor 172.30.1.20 will show if the ftp port version used is vulnerable to a 2011 exploit\nTo see if there are any exploits available in the metasploitable framework searchsploit vsFTPd, this will provide a description of any found exploits\nTo do an entire category scan use nmap --script vuln 172.30.1.20 This is a great starting point for showing the capabilities of nmap and how truly versatile it can be, though it was only a networking port scanning tools but it can do a lot more\n3.
