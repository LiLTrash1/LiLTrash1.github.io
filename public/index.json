Singh, this is a highly recommended book from Packt which have a reputation of providing top quality content for the IT industry. In this part I will be building multiple lab environments with vulnerable machines which I can utilise to test out different penetration techniques in a safe and legal network.\n1. First lab within VirtualBox # The diagram demonstrate the environment for this first network lab where I will be using a popular penetration OS, Kali Linux to test out the different tools that comes within its arsenal.\nFor the virtual machine of choice I went with Vbox due to previous experience with the software in the past however, upon research for different types of virtualisation I came across KVM/Qemu which is a fully open-source and a higher frequency of security update with transparent reports whereas Oracle provides security through obscurity.\n2. Setting up network interfaces using vboxmanage # Inside a terminal type the following commands\nCreate a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;PentestNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=PentestNet --server-ip=172.30.1.1 --lower-ip=172.30.1.20 --upper-ip=172.30.1.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;HiddenNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=HiddenNet --server-ip=10.11.12.1 --lower-ip=10.11.12.20 --upper-ip=10.11.12.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;RedTeamLab\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=RedTeamLab --server-ip=192.168.42.1 --lower-ip=192.168.42.20 --upper-ip=192.168.42.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable 3. Setting up Kali Linux # Going through the standard VMware installation for Kali linux I will need to assign it to networks so it has LAN connection to the other machines.\nIn settings of Kali VM, Adapter 1: Adapter 2: Adapter 3: 4. Setting up Metasploitable 2 # Install the iso file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ and go through standard installation on VMware:\nIn VirtualBox New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: Metasploitable2 \u0026gt; Memory:512M \u0026gt; Hard Disk \u0026gt; Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector \u0026gt; Add Metastpoitable.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish In settings of Metasploitable 2 Adapter 1: 5. Setting up Metasploitable 3 # To install Metasploitable 3 I used Vagrant, a command line utility tool to manage and download virtual machines pre-made on it\u0026rsquo;s repository. The installation process is simple and can be found here https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install.\nThe following commands were used:\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest $ mkdir metasploitable3-workspace $ cd metasploitable3-workspace $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/master/Vagrantfile \u0026amp;\u0026amp; vagrant up Encountering IP address configuration error during setup When setting up Vagrant I encountered an error message on a misconfigured IP range, upon further research I came across someone with a similar problem and found a solution here [1]\nIssue prompt: Fix for IP issue:\nsudo vim /etc/vbox/networks.conf Add an asterisk * in front of the lines *10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 *2001::/64 6. Setting up OWASP Juice Shop website # On the Kali Linux VM terminal: $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | gpg - dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg \u0026gt;/dev/null $ echo \u0026#39;deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable\u0026#39; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list $ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io $ sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop $ sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop Connect to OWASP website http://localhost:3000 7. Setting up OWASP Broken Web Applications # Install the zip file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/\nThis will contain pre-made Vbox machines which needs to be connected to the lab network:\nVM Box \u0026gt; New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: OWASP BWA \u0026gt; Type: Linux \u0026gt; Memory: 1024 MB \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector add: OWASP Broken Web Apps-cl1.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish Click on Settings of OWASP Web \u0026gt; Network \u0026gt; Adapter 1 \u0026gt; Attached to: Internal Network \u0026gt; Name: PentestNet \u0026gt; OK Login : root:owaspbwa This was it for this walkthrough on how to install and setuping up multiple virtual machines and having them connected to a private network for testing, there is an extended section to setup an environment for advanced hacking techniques but will be covered in a later part. Next I will be covering passive information-gather, one of the most important step to a great attack.\nReferences # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70704093/the-ip-address-configured-for-the-host-only-network-is-not-within-the-allowed-ra ","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/part-1-buidling-a-penetration-testing-labs/","section":"Blog","summary":"Welcome to the first part of my walkthrough for \u0026lsquo;The Ultimate Kali Linux Book\u0026rsquo; by Glen D.","title":"Part 1 Building a Penetesting Lab"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pentesting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pentesting"},{"content":"","date":"1 Jan, 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Blog"},{"content":"","date":"1 Jan, 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"}]
