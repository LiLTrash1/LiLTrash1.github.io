Singh. Ever wondered what kind of tools professional penetration testers use to discover vulnerabilities? What to do once you have scanned for technology version? Where to find critical security issues in systems? Well all that will be answered in this section.\n1. Nessus # Nessus is a service which utilises all sort of scanning techniques and provides a central hub accessed through your browser which makes it easy to manage scans.\n1.2 How to Install Nessus on Kali # First install the deb file on Kali linux provided on Tenable Nessus official download page: https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true This should be for platform Linux-Debian-amd64 Debian 10, 11, 12 / Kali Linux\nChange directory where file is download and execute the following commands: $ sudo dpkg -i Nessus-8.15.0-debian6_amd64.deb $ sudo systemctl start nessusd Go to https://kali:8834 in your browser and accept warning to enter the login portal of nessus Register for a activation code at https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus/nessus-essentials and go through the Nessus Essential installation process within the browser setup. If login page is shown instead of activation wizard setup within the web portal, use this guide to register offline: https://community.tenable.com/s/article/How-to-reset-register-your-Nessus-license-for-offline-installations?language=en_US\n1.3 Basic Scans With Nessus # When the setup is completed you will be prompted with the option to provide the program with a list of targets to scan which I\u0026rsquo;ve entered the [Win2k8 IP address from chapter 1]: This will start an automatic Basic scan which will reveal surface-level vulnerabilities which can be seen in the \u0026lsquo;My Scans\u0026rsquo; section in the navigation menu.\nWhen navigating to \u0026lsquo;New scan\u0026rsquo; Nessus will provide different types of scans to choose from ranging from full-fledged scans to specific vulnerability scans: Main types of scans: Host Discovery Basic Network Scan Advanced Scan Malware Scan The basic scan option is great to generate a quick report on surface-level vulnerabilities: I can see the different results from the basic scan which are separated into different types folders which upon clicking will reveal findings of vulnerabilities, version types and information on technology used by the target:\nHere I am looking at the Apache Tomcat folder which will provide further information as to what can be exploited along with the CVE code: A scan will provide vulnerabilities along with it Common vulnerability Score System (CVSS) out of 10 to show danger levels which can be determined by this calculator https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N 2. Making Use Of Nmap\u0026rsquo;s Scripting Engine NSE # For more information check out the documentation at: https://nmap.org/book/nse.html Nmap scripting engine is a repository of scripts which are separated into different categories which can be used along with scans to enrich the reconnaissance phase.\nThe defined categories are as followed: auth, broadcast, brute, default. discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln\nSee available scripts at: https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ nmap --script-help \u0026#34;afp-* and discovery\u0026#34; nmap --script=\u0026lt;keyword\u0026gt; nmap --script=ftp-vsftpd-backdoor 172.30.1.20 nmap --script=vuln 172.30.1.20 3. Greenbone Vulnerability Mananger GVM # Greenbone Community Edition has come to its end-of-life in Jan 2023 and will be fully off Docker hub by June 2024 :( See link for more details: GVM Community Edition 21.04 End of Life This tool seems to be similar to nessus tool which provides lots of options for reconnaissance.\nsudo apt install gvm sudo gvm-setup sudo gvm-start sudo runuser -u _gvm -- gvmd --user=admin --new-password=new_password # reset pass When performing the setup commands for GVM you will be provided with a admin password, make a note of this as this is important as it is needed for the sign in page in your browser: Upon login in you will see the main dashboard with charts, select Configuration \u0026gt; Targets \u0026gt; New Target: After setting a target create a task in Scans \u0026gt; Tasks to perform a basic automated scan on the target you\u0026rsquo;ve set earlier ðŸš§ Incomplete section, need to make time to properly try GVM due to Community version loosing official support. Full installation guide here: https://forum.greenbone.net/t/greenbone-community-edition-22-4-stable-initial-release-2022-07-25/12638 ðŸš§\n4. Using Web Application Scanners # Scanning a machine for all possible vulnerabilities on the surface level is good but what if your target is a website? Well here I will be covering just the surface of different web application scanners which may reveal information that can be of use as a pentester.\n4.1 WhatWeb # Whatweb is a recon tool used to retrieve different aspect of websites such as web servers, OS, content management system and other technologies by sending HTTP request and analysing the response.\nHere is an example of it being used with whatweb \u0026lt;IP\u0026gt;: Whoah, that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of information received from just a basic scan!\nThis tool provides custom depth searches and HTTP header customisation which I will be playing with more in the future so stay tuned.\n4.2 Using NSE Web Application Scanning Scripts # If you remember from earlier we looked at Nmap\u0026rsquo;s scripting engine which provided a huge library of ready-to-use battle scripts for both recon and exploitation.\nTo look at the scripts available for web application you can use pattern search to list what\u0026rsquo;s out there with\n$ ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http* Here are some of the results for http result alone!\n/usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-open-redirect.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-passwd.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-phpmyadmin-dir-traversal.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-phpself-xss.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-php-version.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-proxy-brute.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-put.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-qnap-nas-info.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-referer-checker.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-rfi-spider.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-robots.txt.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-robtex-reverse-ip.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-robtex-shared-ns.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-sap-netweaver-leak.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-security-headers.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-server-header.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-shellshock.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-sitemap-generator.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-slowloris-check.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-slowloris.nse **/usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-sql-injection.nse** /usr/share/nmap/scripts/https-redirect.nse /usr/share/nmap/scripts/http-stored-xss.nse There are so many it\u0026rsquo;s excitingly overwhelming but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, well go through one example together. I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted one of the sql injection script near the bottom as a way to demonstrate script functions.\n# Use sql-injection detection on port 80 $ nmap --script http-sql-injection -p 80 \u0026lt;IP\u0026gt; # Use all scripts starting with \u0026#34;http-\u0026#34; $ nmap --script \u0026#34;http-*\u0026#34; -p 80 \u0026lt;IP\u0026gt; For more information check out the documentation at: https://nmap.org/book/nse.html 4.3 Making Use Of Metasploit\u0026rsquo;s Wmap Scanning Tool # Metasploitable is truly the swiss army of reconnaissance and exploitation, another feature it provides are in-built plugins which provide unique functions compared to the scripts provided by MS.\nWe can load the module within MS with load wmap, if you\u0026rsquo;re curious as to what other plugins available use: load -l Set a main site to tell wmap where it should be scanning, I will be using the Broken OWASP Web application virtual machine created in the labs section:\nmsf6 \u0026gt; wmap_sites -a 172.30.1.23 Specify a directory to perform enumeration on, here I will be using the the \u0026lsquo;mutilliadae\u0026rsquo; challenge: msf6 \u0026gt; wmap_targets -t 172.30.1.23/mutilliadae/ Then perform the attack! msf6 \u0026gt; wmap_targets -l # List targets from sites msf6 \u0026gt; wmap_run -t # List all loaded modules for scans msf6 \u0026gt; wmap_run -e # Run all scans on target 4.4 Nikto # This is an open-source reconnaissance tool for web vulnerabilities, it is helpful to get an overview of what technologies a website is using and potential known vulnerabilities it may have.\nGithub repo: https://github.com/sullo/nikto This tool should come pre-install with Kali but if not, install it using the Github link.\n$ nikto --help # Display help menu $ nikto -h 172.30.1.23 -F csv -o ~/Desktop/result.csv # Set target and save result as csv file This reveals a lot of valuable information on systems that might have misconfigured web technologies which is worth using for a simple tool.\n4.5 WPScan for WordPress websites # WordPress is a framework which allows users to use as an aid for building websites which is similar to Hugo which is what my blog is using.\nWPscan is a pre-install tool on Kali for specifically scanning WordPress websites. To test this I will be using OWASP BWA machine from Part-1:\nTarget: 172.30.1.23/wordpress\n# Display help menu $ wpscan --help # Scan url with user enumeration $ wpscan --url 172.30.1.23/wordpress -e u Results from scan:\nAdmin user name login found:\nThat concludes everything for this part of The Ultimate Kali Linux Book I am reading which is exciting to go through and learn all the different types of helpful tool that I could potentially use on my Pentesting / Hacking journey.

Singh, in this section I\u0026rsquo;ll be going over some active information techniques. These directly interacts with the target which is helpful at collecting juicy information such as ports which can be later on exploited for vulnerabilities and all the exciting stuff.\n1. DNS reconnaissance and zone transfers # When wanting to explore a certain website you will be likely familiar with entering it\u0026rsquo;s name known as a domain (e.g. YouTube.com) which will redirect you to its landing page.\nUnder the hood of the internet we have what\u0026rsquo;s called a domain name server which sole purpose is to take the URL you\u0026rsquo;ve typed and convert it into an IP address which a browser can understand to connect to the correct computer over the world wide web. Similar to a phone book where you\u0026rsquo;d look up the name of a person and find their dial number.\n1.2 Different types of DNS records # A DNS lookup tool will provide different types of records which can give valuable information to create a strong profile on a target.\nThe following are the different record types:\nA: Resolves a hostname to an IPv4 address. AAAA: Resolves a hostname to an IPv6 address. NS: Contains the name servers\u0026rsquo; information. MX: Contains the mail exchange (email) servers. PTR: Resolves an IP address to a hostname. CNAME: Provides a canonical name or an alias. RP: Specifies the person that\u0026rsquo;s responsible for the domain. SOA: Contains information about the administrator of the domain. SRV: Contains a service port number for a specific service of the domain Performing DNS enumeration techniques can provides information such as IP ranges, subdomains, email servers.\n1.3 Scanning for subdomains and name servers # # Display name servers (ns) using host $ host -t ns zonetransfer.me # Display subdomains using dnsmap dnsmap microsoft.com 2. Zone transfers vulnerabilities # Sometimes when setting up a website either by hosting it yourself or going with a service provider there may be some misconfigurations such as allowing zone transfers.\nIts purpose is to allow domain server to easily transfer old records of a known URL to create redundancy incase the primary server is down. Upon request if misconfigured, the DNS will send all records it currently has on a URL which can be used to exploits other part of a target.\n2.1 Performing a zone transfer attack # My target will be zonetransfer.me which has been configure to accept all zone transfer requests for demonstration purposes.\nRetrieve a name server using the [Whois tool]\nUsing the dig command on kali: dig axfr @nsztm2.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me\n; \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; DiG 9.19.21-1-Debian \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; axfr @nsztm2.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me ; (1 server found) ;; global options: +cmd zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN SOA nsztm1.digi.ninja. robin.digi.ninja. 2019100801 172800 900 1209600 3600 zonetransfer.me. 300 IN HINFO \u0026#34;Casio fx-700G\u0026#34; \u0026#34;Windows XP\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me. 301 IN TXT \u0026#34;google-site-verification=tyP28J7JAUHA9fw2sHXMgcCC0I6XBmmoVi04VlMewxA\u0026#34; zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 0 ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 10 ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 10 ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 20 ASPMX2.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 20 ASPMX3.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 20 ASPMX4.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN MX 20 ASPMX5.GOOGLEMAIL.COM. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 5.196.105.14 zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN NS nsztm1.digi.ninja. zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN NS nsztm2.digi.ninja. _acme-challenge.zonetransfer.me. 301 IN TXT \u0026#34;2acOp15rSxBpyF6L7TqnAoW8aI0vqMU5kpXQW7q4egc\u0026#34; _acme-challenge.zonetransfer.me. 301 IN TXT \u0026#34;6Oa05hbUJ9xSsvYy7pApQvwCUSSGgxvrbdizjePEsZI\u0026#34; _sip._tcp.zonetransfer.me. 14000 IN SRV 0 0 5060 www.zonetransfer.me. 14.105.196.5.IN-ADDR.ARPA.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN PTR www.zonetransfer.me. asfdbauthdns.zonetransfer.me. 7900 IN AFSDB 1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 127.0.0.1 asfdbvolume.zonetransfer.me. 7800 IN AFSDB 1 asfdbbox.zonetransfer.me. canberra-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 202.14.81.230 cmdexec.zonetransfer.me. 300 IN TXT \u0026#34;; ls\u0026#34; contact.zonetransfer.me. 2592000 IN TXT \u0026#34;Remember to call or email Pippa on +44 123 4567890 or pippa@zonetransfer.me when making DNS changes\u0026#34; dc-office.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 143.228.181.132 deadbeef.zonetransfer.me. 7201 IN AAAA dead:beaf:: dr.zonetransfer.me. 300 IN LOC 53 20 56.558 N 1 38 33.526 W 0.00m 1m 10000m 10m DZC.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN TXT \u0026#34;AbCdEfG\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me. 2222 IN NAPTR 1 1 \u0026#34;P\u0026#34; \u0026#34;E2U+email\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; email.zonetransfer.me.zonetransfer.me. email.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 74.125.206.26 Hello.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN TXT \u0026#34;Hi to Josh and all his class\u0026#34; home.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN A 127.0.0.1 Info.zonetransfer.me. 7200 IN TXT \u0026#34;ZoneTransfer.me service provided by Robin Wood - robin@digi.ninja.

Singh, for this section I will be covering different passive open source intelligence techniques (OISNT) which are ways to collecting information on a target available openly on the internet.\nInformation doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be secret to be valuable, which is why we should be cautious of what information we put out on the internet. I will be demonstrating common tools used for OSINT, ways to mask investigations from target and how data collected can be used in a attack.\n1. Anonymising Traffic during Investigations # When penetesting an organisation it\u0026rsquo;s important to mask my identity as #1 it will test out the intrusion detection systems in placed and #2 it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to use OPSEC.\n1.2 Using Proxy chaining to mask traffic # A proxy is basicly a computer which you past down requests to a destination for you. A proxy chain is basicly like a relay race where you past the batton (requests) to the next person and they do the same to the last chain.\nHarder to track: Proxy chains are used as they make it harder for a request to be traced back to its original source as logs have to be requested from proxy which can be time consuming and lot of work.\nFind out more on proxies here: [All-on Proxies] 1.3 Using Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to mask traffic # A VPN is similar to a proxy where you relay your traffic to another computer so the request comes from them and shows their ip instead of yours.\nUsing a VPN is great for changing your location but I would say their not a worthy technique to mask traffic as their are lots of issues which arise with VPNs.

Gathering an Organisation\u0026rsquo;s IT Infrastructure # When pentesting an organisation, 80% of the process will be gathering information through the internet and scanners, the other 20% will be exploiting findings and writing detailed reports.\nThere are plenty of tools out there that will scrape the internet for information on a target which I think some are more helpful than others but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to check most of them as one piece of information can make all the difference during recon.\n2.1 Using Whois # Whois is a tool which allows you to pull information from a public database of who is behind a certain domain name. When registering a website some services will provide the option to hide information hosted to the databse for a fee.\nThis includes:\nRegistrants Administrative contact information Dates on registration, update and expiration Registry domain ID Name servers 2.1.1 Linux Whois tool # $ whois \u0026lt;domain\u0026gt; 2.1.2 Website Whois alternative # There are also whois domain lookup tools online which will organise information pulled in a more readable format such as: https://whois.domaintools.com\n2.2 Using Job Listings # Another great way to get information of an organisation\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure is by looking at job postings for IT positions as these will list technologies they may use.\nHere is what I\u0026rsquo;ve found from a job listing for a system developer programmer post, these can all be researched for vulnerabilities especially the MS SQL server (2008-19) as this shows they may use older software. [2]\n2.3 Shodan.io # Shodan is an online provider which allows professionals lookup the domain of a website to provide with:\nOpen ports Known vulnerability CVE codes Technologies used hosted on ports This can be useful for discovering possible entry points on a target but I think this isn\u0026rsquo;t worth the $69/month price tag as most results are from large organisations and isn\u0026rsquo;t helpful for smaller targets.\n2.4 Maltego # Maltego is a reconnasaince tool which provides a unique way to display scans done through the use of graphs to help you visualise the layout of a target. This can automate the process of scanning for publicly accessible servers, IP addresses, employee\u0026rsquo;s email addresses, subdomains of web pages and more. You can start by creating a new graph \u0026gt; entity menu \u0026gt; infrastructure \u0026gt; click and drag domains onto graph Here is a demonstration of Maltgeo scanning Microsoft.com for similar domains and emails it can scrape from the internet. 3. Gathering Employees\u0026rsquo; information # Now it is ever more common to find and gather employee credentials and the culture of an organisation as more and more people use social media as their daily routine which entices them to share things that organisations wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to be exposed online such as:\nPictures of employee badge Technologies used in background such as on screens, cameras, SCADA systems Uniforms and work culture 3.1 Instagram / Facebook / Linkedin # Using Instagram, Facebook and Linkedin can be helpful as most organisations will have an online precense which is worth check for any valuable information, these can be usually found in posts made, tagged posts or events.\n3.2 Recon-ng # The Recon-ng framework is designed to bring all common OSINT tools under one roof for convinience by providing menus for navigation and management of information found.This tool comes pre-installed with Kali and the documents can be found here: https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng In the demo above I have loaded the \u0026lsquo;whois_procs\u0026rsquo; module which will search for names and emails related to a domain. After configuration the run command is used which will execute the scrapping and produce a list of results: 3.3 theHarvester # The Harvester is another tool which is similar to Recon-ng where it serves as a central tool to scrap information such as emails, names, phone number and more from difference sources. It comes pre-install with Kali and its documents can be found here: https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester\n# Open help menu $ theHarvester -h #Perform a scan with specific module $ theHarvester -d microsoft.com --dns-server 8.8.8.8 [module] 3.4 Sherlock # The Sherlock project is a open-source tool which will search over 200 possible social media platforms for a given username. This is especially helpful to scan for a persons online precences once their username is found (e.g. Instagram username can be used)\nInstallation # $ git clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git $ cd sherlock/ $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt Search accounts with:\n$ python3 sherlock \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; $ python3 sherlock \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; --timeout 5 # 5 sec search May result with unrelated accounts to target Sherlock is a great tool however, it may result with accounts that aren\u0026rsquo;t related to the target if their username is common or too broad but it is still worth looking through the list\nThis concludes everything for my walkthrough or the reconnaissance and footprinting section of â€˜The Ultimate Kali Linux Bookâ€™ by Glen D. Singh. In the next section I will be covering active reconnaissance techniques such as nmap, Google dorks, metasploit and more.\nReferences # https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/warning-list/ https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-26/product_id-251 https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester ","date":"24 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/part-2-reconnaissance-and-footprint/","section":"Blog","summary":"Techniques to avoid traces back to identity, browsing the web to collect information on a target and social media account leaks.","title":"Part 2 Reconnaissance and Footprint"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/lab/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Lab"},{"content":"Building virtual machines, installing Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2\u0026amp;3, OWASP web applications and windows machines for advanced testing.\nWelcome to the first part of my walkthrough for \u0026lsquo;The Ultimate Kali Linux Book\u0026rsquo; by Glen D. Singh, this is a highly recommended book from Packt which have a reputation of providing top quality content for the IT industry. In this part I will be building multiple lab environments with vulnerable machines which I can utilise to test out different penetration techniques in a safe and legal network.\n1. First lab within VirtualBox # The diagram demonstrate the environment for this first network lab where I will be using a popular penetration OS, Kali Linux to test out the different tools that comes within its arsenal.\nFor the virtual machine of choice I went with Vbox due to previous experience with the software in the past however, upon research for different types of virtualisation I came across KVM/Qemu which is a fully open-source and a higher frequency of security update with transparent reports whereas Oracle provides security through obscurity.\n2. Setting up network interfaces using vboxmanage # Inside a terminal type the following commands\nCreate a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;PentestNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=PentestNet --server-ip=172.30.1.1 --lower-ip=172.30.1.20 --upper-ip=172.30.1.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;HiddenNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=HiddenNet --server-ip=10.11.12.1 --lower-ip=10.11.12.20 --upper-ip=10.11.12.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;RedTeamLab\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=RedTeamLab --server-ip=192.168.42.1 --lower-ip=192.168.42.20 --upper-ip=192.168.42.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable 3. Setting up Kali Linux # Going through the standard VMware installation for Kali linux I will need to assign it to networks so it has LAN connection to the other machines.\nIn settings of Kali VM, Adapter 1: Adapter 2: Adapter 3: 4. Setting up Metasploitable 2 # Install the iso file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ and go through standard installation on VMware:\nIn VirtualBox New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: Metasploitable2 \u0026gt; Memory:512M \u0026gt; Hard Disk \u0026gt; Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector \u0026gt; Add Metastpoitable.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish In settings of Metasploitable 2 Adapter 1: 5. Setting up Metasploitable 3 # To install Metasploitable 3 I used Vagrant, a command line utility tool to manage and download virtual machines pre-made on it\u0026rsquo;s repository. The installation process is simple and can be found here https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install.\nThe following commands were used:\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest $ mkdir metasploitable3-workspace $ cd metasploitable3-workspace $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/master/Vagrantfile \u0026amp;\u0026amp; vagrant up Encountering IP address configuration error during setup When setting up Vagrant I encountered an error message on a misconfigured IP range, upon further research I came across someone with a similar problem and found a solution here [1]\nIssue prompt: Fix for IP issue:\nsudo vim /etc/vbox/networks.conf Add an asterisk * in front of the lines *10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 *2001::/64 If the windows vagrant machine isn\u0026rsquo;t working try the command: vagrant up win2k8 6. Setting up OWASP Juice Shop website # On the Kali Linux VM terminal: $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | gpg - dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg \u0026gt;/dev/null $ echo \u0026#39;deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable\u0026#39; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list $ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io $ sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop $ sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop Connect to OWASP website http://localhost:3000 7. Setting up OWASP Broken Web Applications # Install the zip file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/\nThis will contain pre-made Vbox machines which needs to be connected to the lab network:\nVM Box \u0026gt; New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: OWASP BWA \u0026gt; Type: Linux \u0026gt; Memory: 1024 MB \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector add: OWASP Broken Web Apps-cl1.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish Click on Settings of OWASP Web \u0026gt; Network \u0026gt; Adapter 1 \u0026gt; Attached to: Internal Network \u0026gt; Name: PentestNet \u0026gt; OK Login : root:owaspbwa Here is what directing to the broken OWASP on a web browser should look like: This was it for this walkthrough on how to install and setuping up multiple virtual machines and having them connected to a private network for testing, there is an extended section to setup an environment for advanced hacking techniques but will be covered in a later part. Next I will be covering passive information-gather, one of the most important step to a great attack.\nReferences # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70704093/the-ip-address-configured-for-the-host-only-network-is-not-within-the-allowed-ra ","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/part-1-buidling-a-penetration-testing-labs/","section":"Blog","summary":"Building virtual machines, installing Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2\u0026amp;3, OWASP web applications and windows machines for advanced testing.","title":"Part 1 Building a Penetesting Lab"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pentesting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pentesting"},{"content":"","date":"1 Jan, 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Blog"},{"content":"","date":"1 Jan, 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"}]
