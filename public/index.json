Singh, for this section I will be covering different passive open source intelligence techniques (OISNT) which are ways to collecting information on a target available openly on the internet.\nInformation doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be secret to be valuable, which is why we should be cautious of what information we put out on the internet. I will be demonstrating common tools used for OSINT, ways to mask investigations from target and how data collected can be used in a attack.\n1. Anonymising Traffic during Investigations # When penetesting an organisation it\u0026rsquo;s important to mask my identity as #1 it will test out the intrusion detection systems in placed and #2 it\u0026rsquo;s good practice to use OPSEC.\n1.2 Using Proxy chaining to mask traffic # A proxy is basicly a computer which you past down requests to a destination for you. A proxy chain is basicly like a relay race where you past the batton (requests) to the next person and they do the same to the last chain.\nHarder to track: Proxy chains are used as they make it harder for a request to be traced back to its original source as logs have to be requested from proxy which can be time consuming and lot of work.\nFound out more on proxies here: [All-on Proxies] 1.3 Using Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to mask traffic # A VPN is similar to a proxy where you relay your traffic to another computer so the request comes from them and shows their ip instead of yours.\nUsing a VPN is great for changing your location but I would say their not a worthy technique to mask traffic as their are lots of issues which arise with VPNs. [1]\nFound out more about VPNs here: [All-on VPNs] 2. Gathering an Organisation\u0026rsquo;s IT Infrastructure # When pentesting an organisation, 80% of the process will be gathering information through the internet and scanners, the other 20% will be exploiting findings and writing detailed reports.\nThere are plenty of tools out there that will scrape the internet for information on a target which I think some are more helpful than others but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to check most of them as one piece of information can make all the difference during recon.\n2.1 Using Whois # Whois is a tool which allows you to pull information from a public database of who is behind a certain domain name. When registering a website some services will provide the option to hide information hosted to the databse for a fee.\nThis includes:\nRegistrants Administrative contact information Dates on registration, update and expiration Registry domain ID Name servers 2.1.1 Linux Whois tool # $ whois \u0026lt;domain\u0026gt; 2.1.2 Website Whois alternative # There are also whois domain lookup tools online which will organise information pulled in a more readable format such as: https://whois.domaintools.com\n2.2 Using Job Listings # Another great way to get information of an organisation\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure is by looking at job postings for IT positions as these will list technologies they may use.\nHere is what I\u0026rsquo;ve found from a job listing for a system developer programmer post, these can all be researched for vulnerabilities especially the MS SQL server (2008-19) as this shows they may use older software. [2]\n2.3 Shodan.io # Shodan is an online provider which allows professionals lookup the domain of a website to provide with:\nOpen ports Known vulnerability CVE codes Technologies used hosted on ports This can be useful for discovering possible entry points on a target but I think this isn\u0026rsquo;t worth the $69/month price tag as most results are from large organisations and isn\u0026rsquo;t helpful for smaller targets.\n2.4 Maltego # Maltego is a reconnasaince tool which provides a unique way to display scans done through the use of graphs to help you visualise the layout of a target. This can automate the process of scanning for publicly accessible servers, IP addresses, employee\u0026rsquo;s email addresses, subdomains of web pages and more. You can start by creating a new graph \u0026gt; entity menu \u0026gt; infrastructure \u0026gt; click and drag domains onto graph Here is a demonstration of Maltgeo scanning Microsoft.com for similar domains and emails it can scrape from the internet. 3.

Singh, this is a highly recommended book from Packt which have a reputation of providing top quality content for the IT industry. In this part I will be building multiple lab environments with vulnerable machines which I can utilise to test out different penetration techniques in a safe and legal network.\n1. First lab within VirtualBox # The diagram demonstrate the environment for this first network lab where I will be using a popular penetration OS, Kali Linux to test out the different tools that comes within its arsenal.\nFor the virtual machine of choice I went with Vbox due to previous experience with the software in the past however, upon research for different types of virtualisation I came across KVM/Qemu which is a fully open-source and a higher frequency of security update with transparent reports whereas Oracle provides security through obscurity.\n2. Setting up network interfaces using vboxmanage # Inside a terminal type the following commands\nCreate a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;PentestNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=PentestNet --server-ip=172.30.1.1 --lower-ip=172.30.1.20 --upper-ip=172.30.1.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;HiddenNet\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=HiddenNet --server-ip=10.11.12.1 --lower-ip=10.11.12.20 --upper-ip=10.11.12.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable Create a dhcpserver called \u0026ldquo;RedTeamLab\u0026rdquo; vboxmanage dhcpserver add --network=RedTeamLab --server-ip=192.168.42.1 --lower-ip=192.168.42.20 --upper-ip=192.168.42.50 --netmask=255.255.255.0 --enable 3. Setting up Kali Linux # Going through the standard VMware installation for Kali linux I will need to assign it to networks so it has LAN connection to the other machines.\nIn settings of Kali VM, Adapter 1: Adapter 2: Adapter 3: 4. Setting up Metasploitable 2 # Install the iso file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/files/Metasploitable2/ and go through standard installation on VMware:\nIn VirtualBox New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: Metasploitable2 \u0026gt; Memory:512M \u0026gt; Hard Disk \u0026gt; Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector \u0026gt; Add Metastpoitable.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish In settings of Metasploitable 2 Adapter 1: 5. Setting up Metasploitable 3 # To install Metasploitable 3 I used Vagrant, a command line utility tool to manage and download virtual machines pre-made on it\u0026rsquo;s repository. The installation process is simple and can be found here https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install.\nThe following commands were used:\n$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest $ mkdir metasploitable3-workspace $ cd metasploitable3-workspace $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/master/Vagrantfile \u0026amp;\u0026amp; vagrant up Encountering IP address configuration error during setup When setting up Vagrant I encountered an error message on a misconfigured IP range, upon further research I came across someone with a similar problem and found a solution here [1]\nIssue prompt: Fix for IP issue:\nsudo vim /etc/vbox/networks.conf Add an asterisk * in front of the lines *10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 *2001::/64 6. Setting up OWASP Juice Shop website # On the Kali Linux VM terminal: $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | gpg - dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg \u0026gt;/dev/null $ echo \u0026#39;deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian buster stable\u0026#39; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list $ sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io $ sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop $ sudo docker pull bkimminich/juice-shop Connect to OWASP website http://localhost:3000 7. Setting up OWASP Broken Web Applications # Install the zip file on the internet at https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/files/\nThis will contain pre-made Vbox machines which needs to be connected to the lab network:\nVM Box \u0026gt; New \u0026gt; Expert Mode \u0026gt; Name: OWASP BWA \u0026gt; Type: Linux \u0026gt; Memory: 1024 MB \u0026gt; Hard Disk Selector add: OWASP Broken Web Apps-cl1.vmdk \u0026gt; Choose \u0026gt; Finish Click on Settings of OWASP Web \u0026gt; Network \u0026gt; Adapter 1 \u0026gt; Attached to: Internal Network \u0026gt; Name: PentestNet \u0026gt; OK Login : root:owaspbwa This was it for this walkthrough on how to install and setuping up multiple virtual machines and having them connected to a private network for testing, there is an extended section to setup an environment for advanced hacking techniques but will be covered in a later part. Next I will be covering passive information-gather, one of the most important step to a great attack.\nReferences # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70704093/the-ip-address-configured-for-the-host-only-network-is-not-within-the-allowed-ra ","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/part-1-buidling-a-penetration-testing-labs/","section":"Blog","summary":"Welcome to the first part of my walkthrough for \u0026lsquo;The Ultimate Kali Linux Book\u0026rsquo; by Glen D.","title":"Part 1 Building a Penetesting Lab"},{"content":"","date":"17 Mar, 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pentesting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pentesting"},{"content":"","date":"1 Jan, 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Blog"},{"content":"","date":"1 Jan, 0001","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"}]
