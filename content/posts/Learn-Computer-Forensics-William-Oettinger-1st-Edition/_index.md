# 1 Welcome Back
Hello, and welcome back to my portfolio.

I took a break from my work primarily due to my mental health and some personal matters. During this time, I was also adjusting to new medication that I take to help stabilize my mood. While essential, this medication brought some challenging side effects like drowsiness, fatigue, trouble sleeping, and restlessness that made it difficult to focus and maintain a creative routine. 

Simply managing these adjustments required a lot of my energy, which meant I couldn’t dedicate time to my projects the way I wanted to.

Now that I’m feeling more balanced, I’m grateful to be back and excited to create again.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. {{<responsive-img src="eye-bat.gif" alt="alt text" width="80px" height="50px" >}}
